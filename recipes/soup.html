		<h4>Ingredients</h4>
		<ul>
			Egusi
            Crayfish
            Assorted meat
            2 Stock fish
            2 Dry fish
            Scotch bonnet
            1 large onion bulb
            Black pepper
            2 Calabar nutmeg
            4 Seasoning cubes
            1/2 tsp Salt
            Palm oil
            Beef seasoning
            Dry ginger or fresh ginger
            3 garlic clove
            2 cups water
		</ul>

		<h5>Steps</h5>
		<ol>
			Assemble your ingredients.
            Soak the stock fish in hot water for 20min
            Wash your meats and place in pot and add blended scotch bonnet mixture
			Add the stock fish and coarsely grounded black pepper, ginger and nutmeg
			Add Salt
			Beef seasoning
			Seasoning cubes
			Slice onions
			Add water enough to cover the meat. I add 2 cups because i want my meat to be soft especially because it has cow skin (ganda)
			Ground your crashfish and mix with the egusi
			Mix till combined
			Add your palm oil to the egusi. Mix and set aside till your meat is soft
			Now scoop the mixture into the your meat as shown in the picture
			Cook till oil appears on the surface. Adjust seasoning to taste
			Now add your ugwu leaves. I washed it with salt and drain before adding
			Tadaa! It's ready. Typically igbo style. You should try it really.
			You can serve with any swallow of your choice.
			Yeppie! Enjoy
			Note: these egusi soup is healthier because the oil is cooked and not fried
